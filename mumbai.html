 <p align="justify">Mumbai also known as Bombay the official name until 1995,is the capital city of the Indian state of Maharashtra. According to the United Nations, as of 2018, Mumbai is the second-most populous city in the country after Delhi and the seventh-most populous city in the world with a population of roughly 20 million. As per Indian government population census of 2011, Mumbai was the most populous city in India with an estimated city proper population of 12.5 million living under Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai. Mumbai is the centre of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, the sixth most populous metropolitan area in the world with a population of over 23 million. Mumbai lies on the Konkan coast on the west coast of India and has a deep natural harbour. In 2008, Mumbai was named an alpha world city.It has the highest number of millionaires and billionaires among all cities in India.Mumbai is home to three UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the Elephanta Caves, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, and the city's distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings.<span id="dots">......</span>

The seven islands that constitute Mumbai were originally home to communities of Marathi language seaking Koli people.For centuries, the islands were under the control of successive indigenous empires before being ceded to the Portuguese Empire and subsequently to the East India Company when in 1661 Charles II of England married Catherine of Braganza and as part of her dowry Charles received the ports of Tangier and Seven Islands of Bombay.During the mid-18th century, Bombay was reshaped by the Hornby Vellard project,which undertook reclamation of the area between the seven islands from the sea.Along with construction of major roads and railways, the reclamation project, completed in 1845, transformed Bombay into a major seaport on the Arabian Sea. Bombay in the 19th century was characterised by economic and educational development. During the early 20th century it became a strong base for the Indian independence movement. Upon India's independence in 1947 the city was incorporated into Bombay State. In 1960, following the Samyukta Maharashtra Movement, a new state of Maharashtra was created with Bombay as the capital.<br><br>

Mumbai is the financial, commercial,and the entertainment capital of India. It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow,generating 6.16% of India's GDP,and accounting for 25% of industrial output, 70% of maritime trade in India (Mumbai Port Trust and JNPT),and 70% of capital transactions to India's economy.Mumbai has the eighth-highest number of billionaires of any city in the world,and Mumbai's billionaires had the highest average wealth of any city in the world in 2008.The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. The city is also home to Bollywood and Marathi cinema industries. Mumbai's business opportunities attract migrants from all over India.

      <p align="justify">The Gateway of India is an arch-monument built in the early twentieth century in the city of Mumbai, in the Indian state of Maharashtra. The gateway's arch has a height of 26 metres (85 feet) with its central dome being 15 metres (49 feet) in diameter. The monument is built of yellow basalt and reinforced concrete. The stones were sourced locally while the perforated screens were brought in from Gwalior.The monument features intricate stone latticework (also known as the jali work)<br>
      The gateway is amongst the prime tourist attractions in Mumbai. The gateway is a protected monument in Maharashtra under the aegis of the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). It is a regular gathering place for locals, street vendors, and photographers.In 2012, the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation moved the Elephanta Festival of Music and Dance from its original location at Elephanta Caves — where it had been celebrated for 23 years — to the gateway, due to the increased capacity offered by the venue.The gateway can host 2,000 to 2,500 people, whereas Elephanta Caves could host only 700 to 800.

        The terminus is the headquarters of India's Central Railway. It is one of the busiest railway stations in India,serving as a terminal for both long-distance- and suburban trains.<br>
         The terminus was designed by British born architectural engineer Frederick William Stevens, in an exuberant Italian Gothic style. Its construction began in 1878, in a location south of the old Bori Bunder railway station,and was completed in 1887, the year marking 50 years of Queen Victoria's rule, the building being named, Victoria Terminus.<br>
          In March 1996 the station's name was changed to "Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus" (with station code CST) after Shivaji, the 17th-century warrior chieftain who employed guerrilla tactics to contest the declining Mughal Empire and found a new state in the western Marathi-speaking regions of the Deccan Plateau.During the 18th-century the state was expanded by the Peshwas to extend over many interior regions of India as the Maratha Confederacy,or the Maratha Empire.The expansion was checked in 1761 by the Afghans in the Third Battle of Panipat, and the empire defeated by the British in 1817–18 in the Third Anglo-Maratha War.

Some collections are more specialized, as, for example, collections of wax medical models once used for training medical professionals. Many museums or displays in historical houses that are not wax museums as such use wax figures as part of their displays. The origin of wax museums goes back to the early 18th century at least, and wax funeral effigies of royalty and some other figures exhibited by their tombs had essentially been tourist attractions well before that.<br>
