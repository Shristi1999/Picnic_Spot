When the British officers got to know about this pleasant forest of Oak and Deodar pine in a congestion of Alpine beauty,they informed their topmost authorities to pressurize the Chamba state to permit them to retract in 1850 this area and build a settlement here in 1851. Maharaja Shri Singh was the Ruler of Chamba state at that time,and he knew that it,would not be possible to protest the pressure of the British.So he permits the British to make a settlement there and in return he had an adequate amount lessened from the amount of taxes that the kingdom of Chamba was honoring the British Raj.In 1853 the sanatorium was licensed.The British active forces built a sanatorium for the convalescent British battalion.A British officer,Lt.Colonel Napier who later became known as 'lord Napier' was the person who took the main pane in the work to receive this big tract of land.

To cheer the higher authorities Sir Donald McLeod named the new agreement 'Dalhousie' after 'Lord Dalhousie' who was the chief representative of British rule in India at that time. The tentative colonial attitude of the British from the taking rulers point of view was evident here as in other parts of India during the British rule.British officer did the arrangement but the laborers for the hard work of building the city came from the hamlets around Dalhousie.The villagers who worked for the British 'Sahibs' were very poor and devoid of many basic needs of life.The photographs of ill bushy hill public often in tatters and with bare feet,puffed and cracked,working for the Britishers contrast vividly against the thick well dressed British who wanted to take all available luxury goods of life.The Christian missionaries who came and lived in the settlement commonly did 'conditional social work' when it suited them for the cause of spreading their religion.The propagation of the religious activities of their community was much more essential to them than the preservation of traditional hill culture and tradition.<br><br>

The general viewpoint of the British people who came to Dalhousie during the colonial days was no different The British force and other people of the settlement required supplies.So some traders from the lowland came and established supply stores at Dalhousie and nearby places.In 1895 the first hotel named the Bulls head was built. In the first half of the twentieth century,a continual flow of tourists from other parts of India begin visiting Dalhousie and more hotels and guest houses were built there.The camp of British regiments was established in Balun. The Balloon has been known as a camp area ever since.In 1868 the sanatorium was established at Balun.
<br><br>

The literate Europeans loved books,so the culture of and keeping books and keeping home libraries came with them to Himachal Pradesh.Drawing room culture,and club culture also came with the Europeans.Modern Indian society in Dalhousie and elsewhere in India has greatly affected by European civilization.Life in Dalhousie' town in nineteenth and early twentieth centuries give apparent examples of the introduction of western lifestyle amongst noble their sections of Indian society.At that ancient time,Dalhousie was one of the hilliest cities where the acquaintance of western values and lifestyle started influencing the sociable setup.
