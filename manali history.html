Manali is full of historical and ancient monuments and is the best place to witness the unfolding antiquity. The History of Manali gives an overall idea of the beautiful region. According to legends, the history continues from the Ramayana period. The name of the river Beas is designated by common traditions celebrated by the saint Vashishtha, whose references are available in the Ramayana. After the death of his son, he lost his interest in life, and jumped in the river with his feet and hands tied. But the divine river burst his bonds and, carried him to the shore. The river came to be known as 'Vipasha' or 'the liberator of bonds.' He then again threw himself into the Satluj but, the sacred waters of the river divided into hundred shallow channels and, sent the sage on dry land. Then the river is known as 'Satadree' or 'the hundred channeled.'
<br><br>

According to the Hindu mythology- Manali was the hometown of the Brahmin law enforcer Manu and got its name after him as he was struck by the beauty and tranquility after wandering through the valleys of Himalayan town. Manali is the changed name from the word 'Manu-Alaya' meaning- house of Manu.<br><br>

The History of Manali is that the seventh incarnation of Manu found a tiny fish who told him to look after it with devotion and then one day it would do him a great service. Vaivasvatatava cared for the fish till the day it grew into a huge one. He released it into the sea but, the fish warned him about a threatening deluge in which the entire world would be submerged and asked him to build a boat. When Manu and other Gods were submerged, they were saved by the seventh avatar of Lord Vishnu by mounting high to drylands. As the earth gradually dried, there arose a place of breathtaking natural beauty which was relevant, for the life to begin again. As the legend says, Manali was completely inaccessible to humans due to its topographical positioning. Today, it is a prime destination which offers high mountains surrounded by white glittering snow. There are thick forests full of cool breezes and birdsong as well as the gardens of wildflowers, picturesque hamlets and fruit loaded orchards.<br>

The Hidimba temple in Manali is believed to be associated with the Pandavas. According to the sagas, Bhimsen killed a strong and cruel demon Hadimb and married his sister Hadimba who was a sturdy deity whereas another legend says Arjuna practiced self-discipline in a cave called 'Arjun Gupha' to get the powerful Pasupati Astra from Indra. During the Mahabharata period, the great sage Vyas have performed his tapa at a place called 'Vyas Kund' on Rohtang Pass.<br><br>


The city is also termed as 'The Valley of Gods.' There is a temple in old Manali dedicated to sage Manu. Manali and the surrounding areas are said to be home to the Sapta rishi or seven sages making it relevant in the Indian culture and heritage.<br><br>


In the 17th century, Raja Jagat Singh brought the statue of Lord Raghunath ji to his throne and, till now he is the presiding god and the king of Manali. In the 20th century, the British started visiting the town frequently due to its pleasant climate, nature and scenic views. With the invasion of Britishers, the culture of Manali experiences a subtle change. The Britishers also introduce the roads, restaurants, churches and other attractions to impress the tourists whereas adventurous activities like skiing, snow-racing and, skating were developed by foreigners. The first apple orchard was set up by them in Patlikulh. Even today, apples along with plum and pear as well are the foremost source of income of the people of Manali. It is one of the reasons that Manali gained the reputation of being a tourist destination.<br><br>


Manali has a unique culture and tradition which is rooted in the hearts of the local people. It is an exciting destination situated on the Himalayas and the Kullu district of Himachal Pradesh at a height of 2625 meters (8612 feet) where the hills of Manali present stunning landscape.
