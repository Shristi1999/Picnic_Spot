Shri Sai baba of shirdi is treated as god of all. Shirdi is considered as a sacred place for hindus and muslims. In the recent past all religious people including orthodox Christians, zoroastrains started worshipping Sai Baba of Shirdi.<br><br>

<h4>Childhood of Sai Baba of Shirdi:-</h4>

Shri Sai Baba was a born in the year 1835 to a Brahmin couple of Patri which was in the Nizam state of British India. Where his parents handed over him to the fakir, When he was 5 years old, these were the words revealed by baba in his last days. But Date of birth is still unknown to the world. There are lots of communities who claims that Baba belong to their respective communities but none of them proven. Have faith and patience - I will be always with you wherever you are.<br><br>

<h4>Life of Sai Baba At Shirdi:-</h4>

  <img src="images\Shirdi\s1.jpg" class="rounded" width="30%"> <br>

Baba came to village Shirdi in Maharastra at age of 16 for the first time. People wondered looking at him that a boy at a very tender age doing deep meditation sitting in asana under a Neem tree, without food and even water for several days. This made to grew lots of curiosity on young baba. Bayajabai, wife of village chief occasionally enquired about the welfare of the sai Baba in his childhood. Gradually she started bringing food to Baba.<span id="dots">......</span>
<span id="more"><br><br>
 As the days passed baba started treating her as his mother. Mhalspati, the village chief and a priest, once possessed by lord khandoba, uttered that there is a holy spirit here pointing towards the Sai Baba.<br><br>

Baba pointed towards the neem tree and asked to dig it to roots. The villagers followed the words of Baba and started digging it. As the layers of earth passed on, they found a slab made of stone, oil lamps glowing without any oil and air too, Which was completely opposite to science. In the same place they found a vessel which is in the shape of cow mouth on a wooden table. Baba clarified that this is the holy place where his guru had done penance. He also suggested that instead of worshipping me(sai baba), worship the tree and leave it untouched. Till today no one touched it. This tree is the first stop of a pilgrim in shirdi<br><br>

Baba was an unique personality who earned a huge attention towards him, in the day time he was not associated with any one and not afraid of any one. Some people thought that he was mad and even hurt him physically by throwing stones at him. Initially Baba spent about 3 years at Shirdi. After this, for a period of one year Baba left Shirdi and very little was known about sai baba during that period. He met many saints, fakirs and even worked as weaver as history says.<br><br>

In the year of 1858, Baba returned to Shirdi permanently. For about five years of time Baba took his accommodation under the neem tree and very often Baba used to wander in the jungle near Shirdi was very uncommunicative as Baba spent lot of his time in meditation. Gradually Baba shifted his accommodation to a nearby mosque. Many Hindus and Muslims were visiting Baba. In the mosque Baba maintained sacred fire which was called dhuni. Baba gave sacred ash to the entire visitor. People believe that ash is the best medicine to heal for all health issues.<br><br>

Baba was god for all and used to participate in all religious festival. Baba had a habit of cooking and the same was distributed among all devotees as "Prasad" at the time of their visit. Baba best pass time was singing (religious) and dancing. Many believed that baba was a saint and even as god. As the time passed on the volume of visitors to Shirdi gradually increased.
